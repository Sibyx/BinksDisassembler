abstract = {From the Publisher: Ideal for a course in computer hardware, architecture, or digital design in departments of computer science and engineering, The Principles of Computer Hardware, 3E, provides a comprehensive introduction to the subject. In Alan Clements noted student-friendly style, this text covers both the 68000 and ARM architectures and in a tutorial or lab-based style suitable for a variety of courses. The third edition has been significantly improved with all chapters having been rigorously updated. Powerful new simultation software has been added which allows the student to visualize digital designs. The chapter on RISC has been completely rewritten to include the ARM computer. The tutorial based introduction to assembly language now includes many examples. Easy to read, student-friendly style. Comprehensive introduction to the subject. Covers two popular microprocessors (68000 and ARM). Tutorial or lab-based approach suitable for many courses.}

These systems have obtained great tallness due to their ample fields of application and, it's lower costs compared with the traditional computer systems. The target of this paper is to show how to design and implement an embedded system based on a soft core processor, and how to port the Linux Kernel-3.0-rc1 operating system on FPGA (Field Programable Gate Array) and on architectural simulator (ISS) OR1ksim. We have chosen the OpenRISC 1200-v3 opensource processor from opencores as soft core processor which is support FPGA and ASIC 0.18um technology and our contribution for OpenRISC architecture in Linux will be included in the upcoming 3.1 release.},  keywords={application specific integrated circuits;embedded systems;field programmable gate arrays;Linux;operating system kernels;portable computers;public domain software;reduced instruction set computing;embedded system;portable systems;chip connect reduction;device size reduction;power dissipation reduction;soft core processor;Linux kernel-3.0-rc1 operating system;FPGA;field programable gate array;architectural simulator;OR1ksim ISS;OpenRISC 1200-v3 opensource processor architecture;opencores;ASIC technology;Linux;Kernel;Embedded systems;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Computer architecture;Booting;Embedded System;Opensource;OpenRISC 1200;Linux Kernel;Opencores;Soft processor;OR1Ksim;FPFA},  doi={10.1109/SETIT.2012.6481909},  ISSN={},  month={March},}
