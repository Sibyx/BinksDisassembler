# BinkDisassembler

Simple desktop disassembler for [OpenRISC 1000](https://openrisc.io/) architecture for macOS written in C# (.NET Core) -
Jar Jar Binks of disassemblers.

According to the official [OpenRISC 1000 Architecture Manual v1.3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openrisc/doc/master/openrisc-arch-1.3-rev1.pdf)
I have created a simple Excel spreadsheet with [list if instructions](docs/instructions.xlsx) for better disassembler analysis.
